One of the most interesting assignments of my dev career has been to explain why my name should appear on one of the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/c-sharp">world's most eminent lists</a> of software engineer expertise. The list is talent-studded by developers with decades (and more) of experience who have successfully undertaken projects for top-tier companies. How could I, with my three years of developer experience, hope to claim a place in this coveted list?

Enter "Tenacity".... A word explained by Merriam-Webster to mean "not easily stopped or pulled apart : firm or strong", "continuing for a long time", "very determined to do something". Tenacity grows out of the belief that there is always a solution; that come what may, with the right effort and resources the goal is always achievable.

One can step back for a moment and consider: what really underpins that collective pre-eminence in the Toptal list? Is it really just the years of experience and the "brand-name" projects? Or perhaps there is a deeper, more powerful force at play. Maybe the tenacity of these exceptional individuals has enabled and empowered them to create solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems, and perhaps it is really tenacity that is at the heart of these decades-long careers.

My developer career has taken an uphill trajectory in many varied ways. Emotionally, physically, financially, indeed from so many aspects and angles my career has been a formidable challenge, and many-a-time I have questioned my path. And yet, I am here today applying to one of the most prestigious talent organisations, and it honestly takes my breath away to think of how far my career has progressed in such a relatively short time.

It comes down to one word - tenacity. With the most incredible tenacious support of those around and close to me, and my own ironclad determination to make this a success, the achievement has been truly outstanding.

And so, yes, I'm up there with all those other stars, shining with resolve to face whatever challenges come our way.
