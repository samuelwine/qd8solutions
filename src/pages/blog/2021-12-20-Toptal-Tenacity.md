One of the most interesting assignments of my dev career has been to explain why my name should appear on one of the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/c-sharp">world's most eminent lists</a> of software engineer expertise. The list is talent-studded by developers with decades (and more) of experience who have successfully undertaken projects for top-tier companies. How could I, with my three years of developer experience, hope to claim a place in this coveted list?
